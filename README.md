This project is a personal challenge to create a snake game algorithm in java, it will actually only work in the console you just have to run the project and set the main class to "Main.java" in /main folder  (such creativity), and click in the buttons to watch the show in the console of your java's editor.
<p>obs : you'll have to grab focus to the respective frame opened in order to change the snake's direction.</p>
